## General stuff to do

### Find best ways to manage survey data pursuant to objectives

Objectives include: making pretty visualizations, providing maps to find the way, and also to assist in the decisions about where to go caving next that would find the most new caves and/or connections. 

At CUCC we use https://survex.com/ for the main set of data, with plan drawings done in tunnelx.  

### Github-based experiments

Caving clubs and expeditions need an effective online forum to coordinate their volunteer work -- be it organizing the expeditions or debugging and drawing up the survey data.  Email lists are no longer adequate, and one system that allows semi-structured freeform work is github, which has the advantage that many people already hold accounts for it.
